Enhancements would need to be done in terms of following up with the experimental subjects, possibly through measurements done sooner and more frequently (say, 1 reading per month for 3 months). Doing so would more than likely allow us to collect more data from a larger portion of the test group, even if some fall off after say, the 1 month point.

This TOT is statistically significant to the ** level (p value of 0.0459 and a 95% CI that does not include 0). The 95% CI has a width of about 1.31, considerably narrower than that of experiment 1.

This TOT is statistically significant to the *** level (p value of 0.000 and a 95% CI that does not include 0). The 95% CI has a width of about 0.66, which is even narrower than that of experiment 2. Due to these findings, we can be confident that the TOT for this experiment is significantly different from 0, and I would probably recommend this treatment over the other 2 due to both the size of the effect coupled with the high degree of statistical significance."

Howerver, we noticed in Experiment 3, which had the highest compliance rate of 30.4%, that the TOT actually increased vs that of experiment 2 (1.0923 vs 0.6638). This is due to the ITT of experiment 3 also being the largest of the 3 experiments, which counteracts the larger compliance rate. The standard error is also the smallest out of the 3 experiments (0.1682), which is directly attributed to the higher compliance rate. Experiment 3 is essentially the optimal mix of having the highest effect size while also having the smallest standard error out of the 3 experiments."

We saw for instance that both experiments' 2 and 3 had statistically significant TOT effect values while also having the highest compliance rates (16.40% for exper 2 and 30.40% for exper 3). However, we saw that the gap for exeperiment 2's CI was about 1.31, while for experiment 3, it was only 0.66.
